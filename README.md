# NewsApp with Web3 Implementation

This project is a news application that aims to provide users with summarized news articles, eliminating the need to read entire articles. The app draws inspiration from the Oneshorts app and incorporates web3 technology for enhanced functionality and user engagement.

## Project Description

The NewsApp leverages web3 implementation to create a decentralized platform that promotes positivity and crowd sourcing. Users can register on the platform and submit links to news articles from sources like India Today. The system performs sentiment analysis on the news articles and rewards users based on the generated score.

## Live App

## Backend Repository

The codebase for the NewsApp's backend can be found in the [newsBackend](https://github.com/haariskhatri/newsBackend.git) repository.

## Features

1. **Summarized News**: The app displays news articles in a summarized format, allowing users to quickly grasp the key information without reading the entire article.

2. **Web3 Integration**: The application integrates web3 technology, enabling a decentralized and secure environment for user interactions and data storage.

3. **User Registration**: Users can create accounts on the platform, providing them with personalized features and enabling them to participate in the crowd sourcing and rewards system.

4. **Article Submission**: Registered users can submit links to news articles from India Today or other sources to be processed by the system.

5. **Sentiment Analysis**: The system utilizes sentiment analysis techniques to analyze the news articles and generate sentiment scores based on their content.

6. **Reward System**: Users are rewarded based on the sentiment scores generated by the system. Higher scores for positive news contribute to greater rewards.

7. **ERC Tokens and Smart Contracts**: The platform utilizes ERC tokens and smart contracts to facilitate secure and transparent transactions, ensuring efficient and reliable reward distribution.
